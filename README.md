## Description

Glofox Beers is a simple one-page application that interacts with the PunkAPI. This app randomly shows you an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer. It also allows you to search _by name_ and _by brewed before_ (date) for all the beers that exist in this API. Note that it only allows the following characters (letters, numbers, hyphens and spaces).

## Tech

Glofox Beers has been developed using the following technologies:

- ReactJS
- Redux (ducks-modular-redux)
- React Hot Toast (for notifications)
- Axios
- SASS
- BEM
- Semantic HTML
- Mobile First
- Jest
- SOLID
- ESLint
- Environment variables
- Firebase

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd glofox-punk-api
npm i
npm start
```

It is also available at the following link:
https://punk-api-glofox.web.app/

## Tests

Run the following command for running tests and check the app coverage:

```sh
npm test
```

## Pending tasks

With more time I would like to add the following features to the app:

- Beer Details page (with full information received from the API).. which is very interesting
- Use the Redux Toolkit to manage state
